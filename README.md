## Running the project

This project has been set up with the standard react-cli script.
Use:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

See https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts for more details


## Brief

Timed: 1 hour

Create a small job capture application. The screenshots have been included in this zip.
A user can have 1-3 jobs or be unemployed (0 jobs).

We are just looking for the component markup and structure.

- *We are **not** looking for logic or state management.*
- *Styling is also **not** important, react-bootstrap has been included in this project but you are not required to use it.*
- *Feel free to include any reasonable 3rd party modules (MaterialUI etc.)*


## Extra
***Only do this if you complete the first task in time and are happy with it. Not doing this task will not impact negatively on your test.***

There is a todo list tab with a (very) basic to do list. Improve it however you feel best.


## Submission

Upload the zip file to a cloud storage of your choice, just make sure its accessible. (e.g. GoogleDrive, github) (tip: don't include the node_modules folder!)
